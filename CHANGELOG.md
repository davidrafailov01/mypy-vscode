# Change Log

## 0.4.1
- Add ability to set environment variables using `mypy.env` and `mypy.envFile`. PR [#101](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/pull/101) by @danlamanna

## 0.4.0

- Check Python code in Jupyter notebooks. PR [#96](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/pull/96) by @arikrundquist.

## 0.3.1

- Add commands `Mypy: Recheck Workspace` and `Mypy: Restart Daemon and Recheck Workspace`.
- Add help link when dmypy executable is not found.

## 0.3.0

- Add `mypy.extraArguments` setting to allow passing additional arguments to mypy ([#35](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/issues/35)).
- Display mypy's error codes with links to relevant documentation (PR [#74](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/pull/74) by @vidhanio.)
- Group long mypy messages into a single VS Code diagnostic (also in PR #74).
- Use Python extension's new environments API for better detection of the active Python interpreter ([#70](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/issues/70)).
- Better error message when running mypy using active interpreter ([#71](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/issues/71)).

## 0.2.3

Add the `mypy.enabled` setting to allow disabling Mypy for a specific workspace or workspace folder ([#41](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/issues/41), PR by @LaurensBosscher).

## 0.2.2

- Fix issues related to daemon not being properly closed: [#47](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/issues/47), [#45](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/issues/45), [#37](https://github.com/matangover/mypy-vscode/issues/37).
- Add `mypy.debugLogging` setting.

## 0.2.1

- Do not fail when `show_absolute_path = True` is specified in the mypy configuration file (#38, PR by @sidharthv96).

## 0.2.0

- The extension no longer uses `mypyls` (the mypy language server). We now use the mypy daemon (`dmypy`) which is built into mypy. This leads to less maintenance burden, full mypy feature support, and easier installation.

- The `mypy.executable` setting is now deprecated (because it used to point to mypyls which is no longer used). Use the new `mypy.dmypyExecutable` instead (which points to dmypy). The extension will attempt to migrate your settings automatically if needed.

- Added support for multiple workspace folders. A separate mypy daemon will be launched for each workspace folder. All configuration settings can be set on a per-folder basis if desired.

- Added the option `mypy.runUsingActiveInterpreter` to run dmypy using the interpreter that is currently selected in the Python extension. Can be useful if you install a specific version of mypy in each project. However, normally this is not needed (your code is always checked against the active interpreter anyway).

- The extension no longer overrides mypy's `check_untyped_defs` setting to true. This means that code inside unannotated functions will no longer be checked by default. If you want the old behavior, create a `mypy.ini` file with the following contents:
  ```
  [mypy]
  check_untyped_defs=true
  ```

- Support the new interpreter storage in the Python extension (experimental replacement for the `python.pythonPath` setting).

- Support more mypy config file options, e.g. `files` and `strict` (in mypyls these options were not supported).
